# Cellular Automaton
Cellular Automaton, according to Wikipedia, "is a discrete model of computation studied in automata theory" [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton](Wikipedia).

This project is a web application simulation of Cellular Automaton, specifically it defaults to Conway's Game of Life, which is a subset of Cellular Automaton.  Conway's game is a metaphorical simulation of life with four rules that govern which discrete cells in a grid live or die onto the next generation.

This project is a refactor from a previous project of mine completed in Summer of 2024.  This version is written in Next.JS with React, instead of Svelte (like the previous version).  It utilizes the Strategy and Factory design patterns to implement a modular rule simulation.
